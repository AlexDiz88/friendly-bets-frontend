Therefore, not all pages of the site may display beautifully on large monitor screens at the moment. There may also be various minor display issues on very small smartphone screens. If you encounter crooked tables/pages, let me know in private.",

In the near future, many different tables, interesting statistics, filters, and sorts for different tournaments, participants, etc., will appear, always up-to-date. At the moment, there is the necessary minimum in the form of the main table, bet list, bet results, and personal account.",

Also, for example, when entering a password, a secure keyboard is used, in addition, all passwords are encrypted using a reliable BCrypt system and stored in the database as a hash. It is physically impossible to hack (i.e., decode back) such a password even if access to the database is obtained. Therefore, you can safely use any passwords to register on the site and be sure that they will be reliably protected.",
